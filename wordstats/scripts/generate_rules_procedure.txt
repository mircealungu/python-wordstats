This document describes the process of obtaining translation rules between two language pairs.

1. Obtain translations:
    -Use translate_article to obtain specific translations from stored articles.
     Translations are obtained from Glosbe API.
    -generate_translations goes through Hermit Dave's frequency word list and translates them through
     Glosbe's API.
    -Words not translated can be manually translated by providing the words to be translated in a from.txt file
     with newline as delimiter and the translation in a to.txt file.
     Executing parse_translation_batch then stores these translations.
     Recommended to use Google translate or reverso in order to translate the words in from.txt.

2. obtain cognates
    -execute cognate_automatic_evaluation with a threshold of 0.6 with language pairs
    -cognates will be stored in whitelist, blacklist.txt and cached

3. Obtain rules
    -execute create_rules with language pair codes
    -copy rules over in rules.txt

4. obtain cognates
    -execute cognate_automatic_evaluation again with a lower threshold of 0.4 with language pairs
    -rules are now applied

The whitelist created after the 4th step is the final cognate list
if step 2 or 4 can take long due to long string comparison, recommended to evaluate these long strings manually
or throw away.
