Translate:
    Responsible for creating translations between two pair of languages.
    Either from Hermit frequency word data (function generate_translations_from_hermit) or
    from a given text (generate_translations).
    Translations can be stored/loaded in/from textfile (candidates.txt) or database.
    See scripts translate_article and parse_translation_batch for an example.

CognateEvaluation:
    Responsible for evaluating word pairs with same semantics for cognativity given a distance_class.
    Either from a Translation object with stored words (generate_cognates) or
    given a word pair (evaluate_wordpair).
    Cognates are stored/loaded in/form textfile or database. The evaluated word pairs stored in
    textfile are split in whitelist.txt and blacklist.txt meaning cognate and non-cognate respectively.
    For an example see script cognate_automatic_evaluation.

EditDistance:
    Three methods are implemented which implement different ways of measuring a distance between two
    word pairs. edit_distance is the recommended distance measure which measured the minimum amount of
    deletions/substitutions/insertions needed to transform one word to another and normalizes the
    number of edits by the length of the largest word.
    edit_distance functions can be given an optional list of translations rules (rules.txt) which
    describes a substitution of strings and does not contribute to length.
    To be used in conjuction with CognateEvaluation where first the distance function is created
    to your liking and then given to CognateEvaluation.
