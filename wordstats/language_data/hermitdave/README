If it is required to add words of a new language it is needed to follow the next steps:

1.Download the aspell dictionary of that language (http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell/dict/) and follow the instructions. Basically you have to download the .tar.bz2 file (the 5 is the newest) and then:
	-Unzip the folder
	-Go with the terminal to that folder.
	-Execute ./configure
	-Execute make
	-Execute make install
	-Execute preunzip 'lang'.cwl (e.g: es.cwl)
You will obtain a .uw file with the dictionnary.

2.It is needed to create a new .txt file and copy the dictionary. Python does not recognize .uw files. After that move the dictionary to the Dictionary folder.

3.Add the XML file with the most freq words of that language with the next format:
	<'Language_added'WordFrequencies>
		<word_name>freq_number</word_name>
	</'Language_added'WordFrequencies>

	Example:
	<DutchWordFrequencies>
		<Mijn>721</Mijn>
	</DutchWordFrequencies>

Place it in the Frequency_lists folder.

4. In Cleaning words code add the next variables:
	-FREQ_WORDS_'LANGUAGE_ADDED' = 'Language_added'WordFrequencies.xml
	-DICTIONARY_'lANGUAGE_ADDED' = 'lang_abbreviation'.txt

Example:
	-FREQ_WORDS_SPANISH = 'SpanishWordFrequencies.xml'
	-DICTIONARY_SPANISH = 'es.txt'

5. Finally, once the code is executed the it will required you an input. It has to be the freq xml file


Improvements we want to do:

Choose directly the .txt file with the freq and convert it in the needed xml file with a python script so that there is no need to add the file manually.
